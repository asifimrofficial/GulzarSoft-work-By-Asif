We need to deliver the script to scrape data form:
https://www.walmart.ca/browse/toys/10011
It will scrape the following fields if available from each product:
-UPC
- Title
- Every image + Video (highest quality possible)
- Product Details
- Product Specs (Spec Name, Content)
- Product Description With their original HTML formatting. But without the style in the tags.
- Game Reviews (Name, Images, Comment, Rating)
-High-quality image URLs
-the reviews
-the UPC (in its field)
The output file will be a JSON format and the script will generate the output in chunks of 100k records max. The proxies will be provided by the client separately if needed.
